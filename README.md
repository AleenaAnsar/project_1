Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial to managing the disease and preventing complications. This project focuses on developing a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to identify individuals at risk of diabetes based on health and lifestyle data.

Objectives:

1.Early Detection: To identify individuals at risk of diabetes before symptoms become severe.

2.Accuracy and Efficiency: To use machine learning models for accurate predictions, reducing dependency on extensive and costly medical tests.

3.Personalized Insights: To offer tailored recommendations based on patient-specific factors.
